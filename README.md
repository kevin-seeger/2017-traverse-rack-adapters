Roof rack adapters for 2017 Chevy Traverse


Roof rack adapters for a 2017 Chevy Traverse with the factory roof rack system. This system drops into the stock C-channel on the roof, and then accepts a set of Yakima CoreBars. 


WARNING: These adapters have not been tested for mechanical strength. Putting roof racks and hauling anything on the roof of your car is a RISK that you are taking. Use caution when doing so.
